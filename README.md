- 👋 Hi, I’m Nick
- 👀 I’m a transportation planner in Toronto and also interested in electricity grids, geospatial analysis, and social and climate equity 
- 🌱 I’m a bottom basement basic coder, more an enthusiast rather than a practitioner. I want to learn more. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on applications related to urban planning
